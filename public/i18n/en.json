    "whatIsTitle": "What is Bacometer?",
    "whatIsPara1": "Bacometer is a free online tool designed to help individuals estimate their blood alcohol content (BAC) based on their personal characteristics and drinking patterns. Our goal is to promote responsible drinking by providing educational information about alcohol's effects on the body.",
    "whatIsPara2": "Whether you're wondering when it might be safe to drive after consuming alcohol, or simply curious about how your body processes alcohol, Bacometer provides a scientifically-based estimation to help guide your decisions.",
    "whatIsPara3": "Unlike simple BAC calculators, Bacometer offers comprehensive resources including information on the effects of both alcohol and cannabis, interactive visualizations of how substances affect your body over time, and educational content about responsible consumption.",
    "whyUseTitle": "Why Use Bacometer?",
    "feature1Title": "Scientific Accuracy",
    "feature1Text": "Based on validated scientific formulas that account for your unique body characteristics and consumption patterns.",
    "feature2Title": "Visual Timeline",

    "feature4Title": "Privacy Focused",
    "feature4Text": "All calculations are done directly in your browser. We don't store any of your personal information or consumption habits.",
    "howItWorksTitle": "How the Calculator Works",
    "howItWorksPara1": "Our BAC calculator uses the Widmark formula, which is a scientifically validated method for estimating blood alcohol concentration. The calculation takes into account several important factors:",
    "factor1": "Your gender (which affects the water content in your body)",
    "factor2": "Your weight (which determines the volume of distribution for alcohol)",
    "factor3": "The number of alcoholic drinks consumed",
    "factor4": "The alcohol percentage of each drink",
    "factor5": "The volume of each drink",
    "factor6": "The time elapsed since consumption",
    "factor7": "Your estimated metabolism rate",
    "widmarkTitle": "The Widmark Formula",
    "widmarkFormula": "BAC = (A × 0.789 × 100) / (W × r) - (MR × DP)",
    "formulaWhere": "Where:",
    "formulaA": "A = Total alcohol consumed in grams",
    "formula789": "0.789 = Density of ethyl alcohol (g/mL)",
    "formulaW": "W = Body weight in grams",
    "formulaR": "r = Gender constant (0.68 for men, 0.55 for women)",
    "formulaMR": "MR = Metabolism rate (typically 0.015% per hour)",
    "formulaDP": "DP = Hours since first drink",
    "howItWorksPara2": "The calculator first determines the total amount of pure alcohol consumed in grams. Then, it calculates how this alcohol is distributed throughout the body's water content. Finally, it subtracts the amount of alcohol that your liver has processed over time.",
    "scienceTitle": "The Science Behind BAC",
    "sciencePara1": "When you consume alcohol, it's absorbed through the lining of your stomach and small intestine directly into your bloodstream. Unlike food, alcohol doesn't require digestion. Once in your bloodstream, alcohol is distributed throughout your body's tissues and fluids.",
    "sciencePara2": "Your body can only metabolize a certain amount of alcohol per hour, primarily through your liver. The enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts alcohol into acetaldehyde, which is then further broken down into acetic acid, and eventually into carbon dioxide and water.",
    "sciencePara3": "Most adults can metabolize about one standard drink per hour (approximately 10 grams of pure alcohol). However, metabolism rates vary based on genetic factors, liver function, age, and even some medications.",
    "standardDrinkTitle": "What is a Standard Drink?",
    "standardDrinkPara": "A standard drink contains approximately 10-14 grams of pure alcohol, but the exact amount varies by country. In most European countries, a standard drink contains about 10 grams of alcohol, while in the United States, it's about 14 grams. Here are some common examples:",
    "standardBeer": "330ml of beer (5% alcohol) ≈ 13g alcohol",
    "standardWine": "150ml of wine (12% alcohol) ≈ 14g alcohol",
    "standardSpirits": "40ml of spirits (40% alcohol) ≈ 13g alcohol",
    "accuracyTitle": "Accuracy and Limitations",
    "accuracyPara1": "While our calculator provides a reasonable estimate of BAC based on scientific principles, it's important to understand its limitations:",
    "limitation1": "Individual metabolic rates can vary significantly",
    "limitation2": "Food consumption can slow alcohol absorption",
    "limitation3": "Medical conditions can affect how your body processes alcohol",
    "limitation4": "Medications can interact with alcohol and affect its processing",
    "limitation5": "The calculator cannot account for all biological variations",
    "limitation6": "Genetics play a role in how your body processes alcohol",
    "limitation7": "Fatigue, stress, and other factors can amplify alcohol's effects",
    "accuracyPara2": "For these reasons, you should never use Bacometer as the sole basis for deciding whether to drive or operate machinery. Always err on the side of caution when it comes to alcohol consumption.",
    "legalLimitsTitle": "Legal BAC Limits for Driving Worldwide",
    "legalLimitsPara": "Legal limits for blood alcohol content when driving vary considerably around the world. Here are the limits for some countries:",
    "limitZero": "0.00‰: Prohibited completely in several countries including Hungary, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates",
    "limit02": "0.20‰ (0.02%): Norway, Sweden, Poland",
    "limit03": "0.30‰ (0.03%): India, Japan",
    "limit05": "0.50‰ (0.05%): Most European countries including Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands",
    "limit08": "0.80‰ (0.08%): United Kingdom (except Scotland), United States, Canada",
    "legalLimitsNote": "Note: Many countries have lower or zero tolerance limits for novice drivers, professional drivers, and drivers of commercial vehicles.",
    "factsTitle": "Interesting Facts About Alcohol",
    "fact1": "Women generally have higher BAC than men after consuming the same amount of alcohol, due to differences in body composition and metabolism.",
    "fact2": "Alcohol is classified as a depressant because it slows down vital functions, resulting in slurred speech, unsteady movement, disturbed perceptions, and an inability to react quickly.",
    "fact3": "About 20% of alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the stomach walls, with the remaining 80% absorbed through the small intestine.",
    "fact4": "Carbonated alcoholic beverages (like champagne or mixed drinks with soda) tend to increase the rate of alcohol absorption.",
    "fact5": "While coffee might make a person feel more awake, it doesn't reduce BAC or help the body metabolize alcohol faster.",
    "ourMissionTitle": "Our Mission",
    "ourMissionPara1": "At Bacometer, our mission is to provide free, accessible education about alcohol's effects on the body. We believe that by understanding how alcohol affects you personally, you can make more informed decisions about your consumption.",
